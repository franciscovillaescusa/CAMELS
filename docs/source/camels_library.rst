CAMELS library
**************

The CAMELS library is a set of python routines specifically written to simplify the analysis of CAMELS data.

Requirements
------------

The CAMELS library has some basic dependencies:

- numpy
- scipy
- h5py
- `Pylians3 <https://github.com/franciscovillaescusa/Pylians3>`_ 
  

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/franciscovillaescusa/CAMELS.git
   cd CAMELS/library
   python setup.py install

If you want to have more control on where the libraries are installed, we recommend instead:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/franciscovillaescusa/CAMELS.git
   cd CAMELS/library
   python setup.py build

This creates a folder called 'build' inside CAMELS/library. Inside build/, there is a folder that starts with 'lib'. Just put the path to that folder in your PYTHONPATH and the libraries will be installed. E.g.:

.. code-block::  bash
		 
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH/Users/fvillaescusa/Desktop/CAMELS/library/build/lib

Distance to k nearest neighbors
-------------------------------

The routine ``KDTree_distance`` can be used to compute the distance to the k nearest neighbors of a set of particles. Note that the neighbor can be a different type of particle than the one considered. For instance, it can be used to compute the distance to the k nearest gas particles from the positions of star particles. The ingredients needed for this routine are:

- ``pos1``. The positions of the particles that are considered neighbors. In the above example, these would be the positions of the gas particles.

- ``pos2``. The positions of the particles for which nearest neighbors are computed. In the above example, these would be the positions of the star particles. Note that ``pos2`` can be the same as ``pos1``: e.g. to compute the distance to the k nearest neighborhs from a set of dark matter particles.

- ``k``. The number of neighbors to consider.

- ``BoxSize``. To account for periodic boundary conditions, set this number to the size of the simulation box. Note that this number may need to be just slightly larger than that, to avoid problems with particles in the edge (e.g., set it to ``BoxSize*(1.0+1e-8)``).

- ``threads``. Number of openmp threads to use in the calculation. Set to ``-1`` to use all the available threads.

- ``verbose``. Whether to print some information on the progress.
  
An example of how to use this routine follows.

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   import camels_library as CL
   import h5py

   ################## INPUT ##################
   # snapshot name
   snapshot = '/mnt/ceph/users/camels/Sims/IllustrisTNG/LH_0/snap_033.hdf5'

   # KDTree parameters
   k       = 32    #number of neighbors
   threads = -1    #number of openmp threads
   verbose = True  #whether print some information on calculation progress
   ###########################################
   
   # read positions of gas and star particles
   f         = h5py.File(snapshot, 'r')
   BoxSize   = f['Header'].attrs[u'BoxSize']/1e3  #Mpc/h
   pos_gas   = f['PartType0/Coordinates'][:]/1e3  #Mpc/h
   pos_stars = f['PartType4/Coordinates'][:]/1e3  #Mpc/h
   f.close()

   # compute distance of each star particle to its k nearest gas particle
   # d is a 1D numpy array with the distance of each star particle to its
   # k nearest neighborghs
   d = CL.KDTree_distance(pos_gas, pos_stars, k, BoxSize*(1.0+1e-8), threads, verbose) #Mpc/h
   

Gas temperature
---------------

The routine ``temperature`` can be used to compute the temperature of the gas particles in a snapshot. One example is this:

.. code-block::  python

   import numpy as np
   import CAMELS_library as CL
   
   # snapshot name
   snapshot = '/mnt/ceph/users/camels/Sims/SIMBA/1P_5/snap_033.hdf5'

   # get gas temperature in Kelvin
   T = CL.temperature(snapshot)


Gas pressure
------------

The routine ``pressure`` returns the pressure of the gas particles of a given snapshot, in units of :math:`(M_\odot/h)({\rm km/s})^2/({\rm kpc}/h)^3`  

.. code-block::  python

   import numpy as np
   import CAMELS_library as CL

   # snapshot name
   snapshot = '/mnt/ceph/users/camels/Sims/SIMBA/CV_12/snap_020.hdf5'

   # compute gas pressure in unit of (Msun/h)*(km/s)^2/(kpc/h)^3
   P = CL.pressure(snapshot)
   

Electron density
----------------

The routine ``electron_density`` computes the electron number density of the gas particles of a snapshot. This routine assumes that star-forming particles are fully neutral and therefore their electron number density is 0. The units of the output are :math:`10^{20}h^2{\rm cm}^{-3}`. Its usage is as follows:

.. code-block::  python

   import numpy as np
   import CAMELS_library as CL

   # snapshot name
   snapshot = '/mnt/ceph/users/camels/Sims/IllustrisTNG/EX_0/snap_030.hdf5'

   # compute electron number density in 1e20 electrons*h^2/cm^3 units
   n_e = CL.electron_density(snapshot)
