**July 2022:** CAMELS has grown! The Astrid suite  --  containing 1,092 state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations run with the MP-Gadget code employing the same subgrid model as the Astrid simulation  -- has been added to CAMELS. The N-body counterparts of these simulations are also available.

**March 2023:** SubLink merger trees have been added for the IllustrisTNG suite.

**March 2023:** A new set has been added to the IllustrisTNG suite: the BE set, for "Butterfly Effect". These 27 simulations all have the exact same initial conditions and are run with the fiducial TNG model, while capturing the intrinsic randomness of the simulation results.
